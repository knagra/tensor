The main.c file has an abstact function called pixel_color that provides the intensitity
of the given color at the given pixel for the given frame.  Implement this function to
use this convenience function.

output_frame in main.c puts out lines representing each panel's RGB values.  The first
two characters are the address of the panel being addressed (between 13 and 30 in hex,
inclusive).  The next 64 characters are the green values in hexadecimal for that panel;
the next 64 are the red values in hexadecimal for that panel; and the final 64 are the
blue values in hexadecimal for that panel.  So there should be 194 characters in total
for each line.

For the entire board, x and y are indexed at the bottom right corner:  The top left pixel
is (x = 47, y = 23) and the bottom right pixel is (x = 0, y = 0).
