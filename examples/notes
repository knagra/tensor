The main.c file has an abstact function called pixel_color that provides the intensitity
of the given color at the given pixel for the given frame.  Implement this function to
use this convenience function.

output_frame in main.c puts out lines representing each panel's RGB values.  The first
two characters are the address of the panel being addressed.  The next 64 characters
are the red values in hexadecimal; the next 64 are the green values in hexadecimal;
and the final 64 are the blue values in hexadecimal.  So there should be 194 characters
in total for each line.  The first two characters represent the panel number (between 13
and 30 in hex), the next 64 represent the green values for the pixels on that panel, the
next 64 represent the red values for the pixels on that panel, and the last 64 represent
the blue values for that panel.


x and y are indexed at the bottom right corner:  The top left pixel is (x = 47, y = 23)
and the bottom right pixel is (x = 0, y = 0).
